# Team Profile Generator

A Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team that generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Intended use

This program is intended to help keep track of team members in an efficient way. Once the team information is entered, a HTML page is generated to display the summary. Information is kept on the HTML page until the file is deleted or recreated.

## How to use

Download all documents for the application. Start the application by running node index.js in the command line. Answer the prompts. The user can enter in any number of Managers, Engineers, or Interns through the command line prompts. Once the user has indicated that no more employees are needed, the application generates a HTML file that can be shared or viewed.
